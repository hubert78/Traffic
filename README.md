# Traffic Sign Image Classifier
# Overview
This is my first image classification algorithm to detect and classify traffic signs. This project is part of Harvard’s CS50 “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python” course. There are 43 different traffic signs in the dataset. The challenge is to build an algorithm to accurately predict each class of image. 

***The Big Picture:*** In the grand scheme of things, this image classification algorithm can be used in automotive self-driving projects to identify and classify the different traffic signs on the road. You can get the dataset [here](https://cdn.cs50.net/ai/2020/x/projects/5/gtsrb.zip)

# Solving the problem
I built a CNN model from scratch and was able to get the model to make predictions of traffic signs with 96.97% accuracy. Building this model was very exciting for me. And so, it got me to get other imaging datasets to challenge me more.
